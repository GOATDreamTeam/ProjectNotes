# Advice from Ryan and TAs for our Objective for Today : 
- Code our Butts Off 
- Work on a Specific Card, one at a time, without thinking of the overall Application 
- Split into 2 groups 
- Group 1: Functionality of List Page  (Briseida, Breeann, Rachel)
    - List Page Peeps (Group 1 )
        - 1st priority  
            - 1 list page and should connect to the backend 
            - when we click submit, should make a request to the backend and get a list of plants 
                - handlechange 
        - 2nd priority - link to the detail page (even if this is empty <Link to="">) (2pm)
        - 3rd priority - Autocomplete (5pm)
            - for now, just want it to return anything (even if we type in 'fer' and we get pickle lol )
        - 4th priority - CSS (5pm and on)
            - by end of day: not just white page styling so we have a good start for tomorrow 
- Group 2: Basic Styling of the Detail Page (Langston, Nikki)
    - Detail Page Peeps (Group 2): 
        - make sure you can get a detail for the backend fetch 
        - Please Remember: not populating our database until upon click
            - this action would happen on the list page for note
        - Styling (not just basic white background for tomorrow)

## Tech Debt for Slow Images 
- lazyloading - shows a spinner while image is loading 
- set max width and height for the image and set it to auto, to keep same aspect ratio or gutters for the remaining white space that it doesn't fill 
- choose a decent background color to compliment this
