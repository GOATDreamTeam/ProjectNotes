# Idea Pitches - August 18th, 2020 

## Langston: 
1. https://www.gbif.org/ 
    - user would upload the photo, and user would get back taxonomy info 
    - D3 map 
    - info from wikipedia to look up animals and incorporate our other techs we talked about 
    - Google Vision - take a pic and gives all the potential matches 
        - Google Vision API gives photos 

    - Other API Links: 
        - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/inaturalist#node-track2
        - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/ebird-rest-api-v20
        - https://www.gbif.org/developer/species
        - Typescript: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM&t=442s 

2. Rock, Paper, Scissors and using Geolocation for players 

## Rachel: 
1. Dream Interpretation App 
    - pair this with subconscious archtype symbolism 
    - type in certain subjects in the dreams, collection of symbols and store it, and will return a list of all the meanings for those symbols 
    - also can help track reoccurring themes ex: water 
    - track location and have a location map that has most popular symbols of where you live 

    - Other API Links: 
        - https://aras.org/ 

2. Grant Research App 
    - https://www.grants.gov/s2s/grantor/restful-apis.html

3. Climate Change and Pair with Concrete Actions that You can Take to Reduce Carbon Footprint 
    - user signs up, here's how your area will change in the x amount of years 
    - here is the action you can take to reduce: paper bags, compost, riding bike, public transport, etc. 
        - track how much they're reducing their carbon footprint 

    - Other API Links: 
        - https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/902061-climate-data-api#:~:text=The%20Climate%20Data%20API%20provides,World%20Bank's%20Terms%20of%20Use 

## Nikki: 
1. Filter Photo App 

2. Random Inspiration of Art 
    - similar to Tumblr 
    - create Moodboard? 
        - functionality to save photos to a moodboard 
    - visuals 
    - Could incorporate this with the species, resizing images and making a responsive web design with artwork, taxonomy, etc. 

## Briseida
1. Research Lab 
    - grabbing youtube tutorials, jstore(sp?) for downloadable essays or books, spotify for podcasts and lectures 
    - cookies or search history, come up with some sort of recommendation
        - could be cool to suggest things, based on similar users search history 
        - Other API Links: 
            - https://www.si.edu/openaccess 

2. Images of a place over time, similar to a moodboard-ish format 
    - if you're getting data of a specific region of the world, such as climate change, etc. 
    - Visual representation of change over time 
    - Click into the images and get details of when they were taken
        - Timelines in which you shift the time period, then the image is able to respond and change 

3. Website was a Globe, responsive to browser drag, click anywhere in the world, and it would spit back info of species in that region 
    - How did those species change over time? Are they endangered, extinct, etc? 
    - Combine with animation idea with Langston 
    - API Links: 
        - https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/

4. Plant App
- https://docs.trefle.io/reference/#operation/searchSpecies 

## Breeann 
1. Creating a feature, despite content, that can switch between modes of visual impairment, so far I've seen about 4 color palletes depending on the specific visual impairment, but think this could work for any of our apps
    - inspiration: dark and light mode 

2. A way to track environmental impact and specific endangered species would be cool, but not as cool as Langston's Google Vision API lol 

# Collaborative Ideas for the Team to Keep in Mind: 
- accessiblity on both web and phone view 
- accessibility mode through toggle and css for different color schemes and visual impairment 

# Features we're interested in Doing: 
## Rachel 
- accessibility toggle 
- visualization with D3 
- really polished front-end with Sass 
- Ideas that are exciting: 
    - track dealing with climate change, and how it affects other things such as animals in an area, earth has changed over period of time 
    - population growth vs fires, comparing data visualization of greater impacts 
    - responsive web design 
- Suggestions: 
    - use Wikipedia API to return specific information about an animal to navigate difficulties with taxonomy 

## Breeann 
- accessibility toggle 
- responsive web design 
- Sass 
- Google Vision idea with a combination of Climate Change or impacts 
- Dream interpretation 

## Briseida 
- accessibility toggle
- responsive web design translated to app 
- connection between human and nature or human and animal 
- not just visually stimulating, but looks accessible so far 
- bridge the gap between human and animal 
- symbolism, but how would this work with the scientific aspect of the site? 
- would like to have data visualization
- jacob and jasmine's project: made in the interest that people would use it  
- taxonomy project is the one that Briseida is most comfortable with

## Langston 
- idea of having an image lookup for animals and their photographs 
- track your pollution app/ carbon footprint 
- dream application as well 
- Google Earth is also interesting but worried about access to API 

## Nikki 
- https://www.gbif.org/  
    - like the inaturalist link that comes from here 
    - https://www.inaturalist.org/observations  
- Carbon Footprint App 
- Dream Interpretation App 
- Research Lab App as well 
- What is more interesting is what we do with this information 
    - visualization aspect within this 
- Less drawn towards maps, but would be fun to use different ways to present info or compelling with our narrative 
- How to choose narrative and user interaction between views/components 
- Accessiblity color toggle 
- Other API Links: 
    - https://www.gbif.org/dataset/50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7
    - https://www.inaturalist.org/observations 

## All of the Choices: 
- Plant App - Briseida, Rachel, Breeann, Nikki, Langston
    - maybe combine Taxonomy(Google Vision API)? 
- ~~Dream Interpretation~~ - Nikki, Rachel, Langston
- ~~Research Lab~~
- ~~Grant Lab~~
- ~~Photo Filter App~~ 
- Carbon Footprint/ Climate Change - Briseida, Rachel, Breeann, Nikki, Langston 
- ~~Taxonomy (Google Vision API)~~ - Breeann

# TA & Ryan Notes: 
## Top 2 Main Ideas: 
1. Plant App/ Combo with Taxonomy
    - APIs
        - https://docs.trefle.io/docs/advanced/plants-fields
    - 2 different fetches of API Calls, one for one API and a 2nd for another API to connect the two 

2. Carbon Footprint/ Climate Change
    - APIs 
        - https://coolclimate.org/calculator 
        - https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/902061-climate-data-api#:~:text=The%20Climate%20Data%20API%20provides,World%20Bank's%20Terms%20of%20Use. 

- Find API or Dataset that doesn't require a lot of time, so we can focus on visualization 
- Spend time drawing up a plan of what we want our page to look like
    - what type of visualizatin
    - what type of variety 
    - 

## Tech we want to use: 
- D3 
- Colorblind Toggle Theme 
- Sass 
- Responsive Web Design for Phone and Computer 


# Rubric Day 1 Outline: 
- pitch idea
- research libraries and APIs you may need
