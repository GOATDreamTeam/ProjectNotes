# Idea Pitches - August 18th, 2020 

## Langston: 
1. https://www.gbif.org/ 
    - user would upload the photo, and user would get back taxonomy info 
    - D3 map 
    - info from wikipedia to look up animals and incorporate our other techs we talked about 
    - Google Vision - take a pic and gives all the potential matches 
        - Google Vision API gives photos 

    - Other API Links:

        - https://www.gbif.org/developer/species
        - Typescript: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM&t=442s 

2. Rock, Paper, Scissors and using Geolocation for players 

## Rachel: 
1. Dream Interpretation App 
    - pair this with subconscious archtype symbolism 
    - type in certain subjects in the dreams, collection of symbols and store it, and will return a list of all the meanings for those symbols 
    - also can help track reoccurring themes ex: water 
    - track location and have a location map that has most popular symbols of where you live

2. Grant Research App 
    - https://www.grants.gov/s2s/grantor/restful-apis.html

3. Climate Change and Pair with Concrete Actions that You can Take to Reduce Carbon Footprint 
    - user signs up, here's how your area will change in the x amount of years 
    - here is the action you can take to reduce: paper bags, compost, riding bike, public transport, etc. 
        - track how much they're reducing their carbon footprint

## Nikki: 
1. Filter Photo App 

2. Random Inspiration of Art 
    - similar to Tumblr 
    - create Moodboard? 
        - functionality to save photos to a moodboard 
    - visuals 
    - Could incorporate this with the species, resizing images and making a responsive web design with artwork, taxonomy, etc. 

## Briseida
1. Research Lab 
    - grabbing youtube tutorials, jstore(sp?) for downloadable essays or books, spotify for podcasts and lectures 
    - cookies or search history, come up with some sort of recommendation
        - could be cool to suggest things, based on similar users search history 
        - Other API Links: 
            - https://www.si.edu/openaccess 

2. Images of a place over time, similar to a moodboard-ish format 
    - if you're getting data of a specific region of the world, such as climate change, etc. 
    - Visual representation of change over time 
    - Click into the images and get details of when they were taken
        - Timelines in which you shift the time period, then the image is able to respond and change 

3. Website was a Globe, responsive to browser drag, click anywhere in the world, and it would spit back info of species in that region 
    - How did those species change over time? Are they endangered, extinct, etc? 
    - Combine with animation idea with Langston 
    - API Links:

## Breeann 
1. Creating a feature, despite content, that can switch between modes of visual impairment, so far I've seen about 4 color palletes depending on the specific visual impairment, but think this could work for any of our apps
    - inspiration: dark and light mode 

2. A way to track environmental impact and specific endangered species would be cool, but not as cool as Langston's Google Vision API lol 

# Collaborative Ideas for the Team to Keep in Mind: 
- accessiblity on both web and phone view 
    - 


# Rubric Day 1 Outline: 
- pitch idea
- research libraries and APIs you may need
    - test the libraries and APIs to make sure they work
    - make proof of concepts
- DEMO: present your proposed idea and show us some API or library you may use

## Group Project: Pitch Ideas
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. Youâ€™ve selected a group around an idea. Formalize your idea and come up with:
- An MVP: What will you demo?
- Challenges: Why is it interesting? What are the challenges?
- High Level Plan: What steps do you need to do to accomplish your goals?
