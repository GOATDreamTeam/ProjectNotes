## JSS Notes from Ryan 
- Ryan sent this here: https://cssinjs.org/react-jss?#dynamic-values
    - instaed of passing prop, you can pass theme (this could be a set further )
    - for color example: theme? === 'light' ? 'white' : 'black' 

- Ryan said to focus on the example of Dynamic Values 
    - create a hook called UsedStyles 
    - write css here 
    - the props is the value that we pass to useStyles in the button 
        - instead of props, we would call it theme 
        - so if theme is accessiblity, make it green, otherwise make it red 
        - would have props be accessibility mode
