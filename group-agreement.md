# Main Agreements:

-We notified and will continue to notify others of outside obligations.

-Agree to keep each other on track for breaks.

-Agree to end the day at 5 after presentation demos.

-Agree to remain flexible depending on project needs as we continue on.

*Some of us are cool with late-nite working: Rachel, Nikki, Langston, as needed.*




# Conflict/concerns policy:

1. What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
Agree to call things out if there are blatantly racist/sexist comments.  

Be open to constructive feedback.  Try to communicate to each other so we can create an opportunity for improvement, and change.  Still feel free report issues to higher-ups if necessary, but try to give everyone an opportunity to be part of the conversation.

Bring back reports of how we solved conflicts to higher-ups.

*Any time anyone seems to be getting a little frustrated, or something seems confusing, or communication seems difficult -- TAKE A BREAK!!*

-if you feel like someone isn't participating, invite them in on the work or ask what they think of the issue.  Then if it's not working, maybe ask them 1-1 if there's something going on, see if they want to work on another area of the project.  
  -if all else fails, talk to a TA.


Weekends/After Hours
-use weekends/nights for rest
  -if there's something you're interested in looking into/playing around with, feel free to post about it so others can join in if they're free and want to participate.

Overarching rule- nights / weekends NO expectation to work unless you want to.  

NO CODING unless it's sand boxing OR you're working with another person. -keep everyone in the loop so we all know what everyone's working.





1. Technologies/libraries
Give a certain amount to research and decide on a technology/library, but be open to hearing from others when we don't feel like it will serve us for our project.

  -Can you make a good proof-of-concept for using the thing you want to use?

  -Use TA/Instructor advice LIBERALLY

  -Mob on things that are larger, pair people together who are interested in working on similar things

  -Small things can be better to split off to individual tasks where and when appropriate.

  -Normalize needs when it comes to be able to drive, when you need to process something.  

  -Be as clear as possible, and go with what the driver needs as far as communicating (line numbers, using annotations, etc). Be as specific as possible!!!
    -make sure others/driver sees the annotations, then clear it
    -use line numbers as often as possible
      -please use line number and a half terminology
  
Majority vote wins.

-Share useful tools!!!



# WORKFLOW-
Morning standups

Convene around 4:30 for end-of-day standups. -use time to figure out what we want to demo that day and write journal together.

Branch names: features/ fix/ bug/ as branch prefix.  Add a card if it's related to a card.  Exclude numbers. Maybe give cards relevant titles wherever possible to avoid using numbers in branch names.

Commit as early as possible whenever something is working, even the SMALLEST thing.  Be as descriptive as possible in commit messages.

  1. communicating clearly on tickets and who's working on them, make sure they are relevant and broken down into small pieces.  Make sure groups aren't working on the same thing.
  1. Communicate which tickets might be affected by others.  If you think you're touching files that another group is working on or will be needing, talk about it so that your approach is unified.
  1. Always check in with each other when refactoring any code, especially if it's something that a different person worked on previously.
  1. deploy code to staging site every night, and deploy *totally finished* code as often as possible.

How do we want to resolve tickets and do code reviews?
-make sure each ticket has a test.  Have at least 2 people, maybe 3 people review the code.  

-as features are finished and code is submitted, send a message to let everyone know that you're ready to move on to another ticket.

-if tickets are synchronous, put/group those together. Get approval and have reviews before you move on to the next piece. Maybe MOB all of these.

-If they're asynchronous and not dependent on other cards, they can be worked on in pairs or individually. (presentational stuff, button color, maybe updating snapshots, etc)



# Strategy for hearing voices-
  1. pausing, being silent for a moment to consider any points or suggestions.  
  1. check in to make sure everyone agrees on work and project direction
